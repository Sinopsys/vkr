abstract = {Ledger-based systems that support rich applications often suffer from two limitations. First, validating a transaction requires re-executing the state transition that it attests to. Second, transactions not only reveal which application had a state transition but also reveal the application's internal state. We design, implement, and evaluate ZZZZ, a ledger-based system where users can execute offline computations and subsequently produce transactions, attesting to the correctness of these computations, that satisfy two main properties. First, transactions hide all information about the offline computations. Second, transactions can be validated in constant time by anyone, regardless of the offline computation. The core of ZZZZ is a construction for a new cryptographic primitive that we introduce, decentralized private computation (DPC) schemes. In order to achieve an efficient implementation of our construction, we leverage tools in the area of cryptographic proofs, including succinct zero knowledge proofs and recursive proof composition. Overall, transactions in ZZZZ are 968 bytes regardless of the offline computation, and generating them takes less than a minute plus a time that grows with the offline computation. We demonstrate how to use ZZZZ to realize privacy-preserving analogues of popular applications: private decentralized exchanges for user-defined fungible assets and regulation-friendly private stablecoins.},

@article{Groth2015,
abstract = {We construct a 3-move public coin special honest verifier zero-knowledge proof, a so-called Sigma-protocol, for a list of commitments having at least one commitment that opens to 0. It is not required for the prover to know openings of the other commitments. The proof system is efficient, in particular in terms of communication requiring only the transmission of a logarithmic number of commitments. We use our proof system to instantiate both ring signatures and zerocoin, a novel mechanism for bitcoin privacy. We use our Sigma-protocol as a (linkable) ad-hoc group identification scheme where the users have public keys that are commitments and demonstrate knowledge of an opening for one of the commitments to unlinkably identify themselves (once) as belonging to the group. Applying the Fiat-Shamir transform on the group identification scheme gives rise to ring signatures, applying it to the linkable group identification scheme gives rise to zerocoin. Our ring signatures are very small compared to other ring signature schemes and we only assume the users' secret keys to be the discrete logarithms of single group elements so the setup is quite realistic. Similarly, compared with the original zerocoin protocol we rely on a weak cryptographic assumption and do not require a trusted setup. A third application of our Sigma protocol is an efficient proof of membership of a secret committed value belonging to a public list.},

@article{DeLeon2018,
abstract = {3D printing has revolutionized a number of industries, but complete extension to electronics, robotics, and machines has yet to be realized. Current limitations are due to the absence of reliable and facile methods and materials for accessing conductive 3D printed materials. Traditional approaches to conducting nanocomposites (melt-mixing and solution-mixing) require high energy, are time-consuming, or demand functionalization for compatibilization between filler and matrix. Moreover, these methods usually require a high loading of nanofiller to establish a network of conductive particles (high percolation threshold). As such, access to conductive structures using standard 3D printing techniques and easily accessible starting materials is ideal for realizing next generation conductive polymer composites, with the added benefit of tailorability of size and shape of objects produced. Herein we present a facile method to prepare conductive polymer-based powder by assembling graphene oxide nanosheets on the surface of commercial polymer powder, then reduce the nanosheets to render them electrically conductive, and 3D print by selective laser sintering. Importantly, this simple and scalable method allows for polymer particles covered with carbon nanoparticles to be used to 3D print useful electrically conductive structures without a change to processing parameters compared to the polymer particles themselves. The chemical composition and mechanical and electrical properties of the composite materials were characterized, and we report the first example of a working electrostatic motor composed completely of 3D printed pieces, without any metal parts.},

@article{Noether2016,
abstract = {This article introduces a method of hiding transaction amounts in the strongly decentralized anonymous cryptocurrency Monero. Similar to Bitcoin, Monero is a cryptocurrency which is distributed through a proof-of-work “mining” process having no central party or trusted setup. The original Monero protocol was based on CryptoNote, which uses ring signatures and one-time keys to hide the destination and origin of transactions. Recently the technique of using a commitment scheme to hide the amount of a transaction has been discussed and implemented by Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell. In this article, a new type of ring signature, A Multilayered Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group signature is described which allows one to include a Pedersen Commitment in a ring signature. This construction results in a digital currency with hidden amounts, origins and destinations of transactions with reasonable efficiency and verifiable, trustless coin generation. The author would like to note that early drafts of this were publicized in the Monero Community and on the {\#}bitcoin-wizards IRC channel. Blockchain hashed drafts are available showing that this work was started in Summer 2015, and completed in early October 2015. An eprint is also available at http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1098. },

abstract = {In this paper we analyze the mathematical foundations of IOTA, a cryp- tocurrency for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) industry. The main feature of this novel cryptocurrency is the tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for stor- ing transactions. The tangle naturally succeeds the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and offers features that are required to establish a machine- to-machine micropayment system. An essential contribution of this paper is a family of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. These algorithms select attachment sites on the tangle for a transaction that has just arrived.},

@article{Poelstra2016,
abstract = {At about 04:30 UTC on the morning of August 2nd, 2016, an anonymous person using the name Tom Elvis Jedusor signed onto a Bitcoin research IRC channel, dropped a document hosted on a Tor hidden service[Jed16], then signed out. The document, titled Mimblewimble, described a blockchain with a radically different approach to transaction construction from Bitcoin, supporting noninteractive merging and cut-through of transactions, confidential transactions, and full verification of the current chainstate without requiring new users to verify the full history of any coins. Unfortunately, while the paper was detailed enough to comminicate its main idea, it contained no arguments for security, and even one mistake1 . The purpose of this paper is to make precise the original idea, and add further scaling improvements developed by the author. In particular, Mimblewimble shrinks the transaction history such that a chain with Bitcoin's history would need 15Gb of data to record every transaction (not including the UTXO set, which including rangeproofs, would take over 100Gb). Jedusor left open a problem of how to reduce this; we solve this, and combine it with existing research for compressing proof-of-work blockchains, to reduce the 15Gb to less than a megabyte.},
