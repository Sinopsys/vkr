The Blockchain technology is typically associated with Bitcoin, because it was
the first system which has been distributed using the Blockchain technology.
As the technologies evolved, the number of various blockchains with different
kinds of applications had been drastically risen. A huge amount of blockchains
can be explained by various cryptographic algorithms and protocols usage in
them. It brought a problem of the absence of systematically gathered and
structured information about cryptographic algorithms and protocols in existing
distributed ledgers. The main objective of this work is to generalise all known
common cryptographic algorithms and protocols, which are being used nowadays.
The algorithms used in blockchains are going to be classified by common
metrics: time complexity, space complexity, and the resistance to hacking. It
is also intended to bring a programming library, where analyzed algorithms and
protocols are gathered in one place. The library would serve as a toolbox for
developers when creating a personal distributed ledger.  Structured information
and an accompanying programming toolbox will preliminary cause positive effect
on approaching extension in this area.
