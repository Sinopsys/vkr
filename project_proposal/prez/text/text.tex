\section*{Prezentation text}

Hello, ladies and gentelmen. My name is Kirill Kupriyanov and today's topic is
my research thesis Cryptographic Algorithms and Protocols for Distributed
Ledgers.

For definitions:
:w
Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a digital system for recording the transaction of assets in which the transactions and their details are recorded in multiple places at the same time. Unlike traditional databases, distributed ledgers have no central data store or administration functionality.


In a distributed ledger, each node processes and verifies every item, thereby generating a record of each item and creating a consensus on each item's veracity. A distributed ledger can be used to record static data, such as a registry, and dynamic data, i.e., transactions.

This computer architecture represents a significant revolution in record-keeping by changing how information is gathered and communicated.
