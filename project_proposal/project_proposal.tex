\section*{RAW Abstract}
The Blockchain technology is commonly associated with Bitcoin, since it was the
earliest popular use of the Blockchain technology. As the technologies evolved,
the number of various blockchains with different kinds of applications had
drastically risen. The huge number of blockchains can be explained by the usage
of the variety of cryptographic algorithms and protocols in them.\\
This study examined all known (up to day) common cryptographic algorithms and
protocols, which are being used nowadays.\\
The algorithms used in blockchains were classified by time complexity, space
complexity, and the resistance to hacking.\\
There is no ``the most secure'' algorithm, nor the ``the fastest'' algorithm.
Scrypt hashing is faster than SHA-256 hashing, but less secure to cracking
(although there was no evidence of any case of cracking this algorithm yet).
There are DLs, which are not blockchains and use completely different
technology, like DAG in IOTA cryptovalue. These kinds of algorithms basically
have the same functionality, but different metrics must be used in order to
measure them. There are also algorithms, which are not yet known to public.\\
